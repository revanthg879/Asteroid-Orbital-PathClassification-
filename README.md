# The Asteroid Orbital Path Prediction 
This model employing Support Vector Machines (SVM) has yielded valuable insights into the realm of Asteroids. By analysing historical Asteroid data and leveraging the power of SVM, we have created a predictive model capable 
of identifying the orbital path of the asteroids. Through careful data preprocessing, feature 
selection, and SVM model training, we have successfully developed a tool that can make binary 
predictions about Asteroid Orbital path prediction with reasonable accuracy. The model's 
evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, provide a 
comprehensive understanding of its performance. The model achieved accuracy of 96%.
# Network Intrusion detection classification using Decision Trees 
In the project focused on successfully creating a robust model capable of accurately categorizing network 
intrusion based on several key attributes. This model's interpretability is a significant 
advantage, as it allows professionals and researchers to easily understand and trust its 
predictions. After rigorous data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature selection, our 
Decision Tree model was constructed, optimized, and evaluated. We are pleased to report that 
our model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 100% on the testing datasets.
