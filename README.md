# The Asteroid Orbital Path Prediction 
THis model employing Support Vector Machines (SVM) has yielded valuable insights into the realm of Asteroids. By analysing historical Asteroid data and leveraging the power of SVM, we have created a predictive model capable 
of identifying the orbital path of the asteroids. Through careful data preprocessing, feature 
selection, and SVM model training, we have successfully developed a tool that can make binary 
predictions about Asteroid Orbital path prediction with reasonable accuracy. The model's 
evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, provide a 
comprehensive understanding of its performance. The model achieved accuracy of 96%.
